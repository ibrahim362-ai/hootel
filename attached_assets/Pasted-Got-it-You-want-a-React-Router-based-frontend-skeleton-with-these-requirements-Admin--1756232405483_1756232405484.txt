Got it 👍 You want a **React Router–based frontend skeleton** with these requirements:

* **Admin routes** → `/admin/...` (full control, all modules).
* **Employer routes** → separated by domain:

  * `/employer/rooms/...` → Employer Rooms Dashboard & modules
  * `/employer/restaurant/...` → Employer Restaurant Dashboard & modules
  * `/employer/gym/...` → Employer Gym Dashboard & modules
* **Public (User/Guest) routes** → accessible without login → `/` (Home + all guest modules).

I’ll write you a **prompt** that defines the **file structure, routing, role separation, and skeleton pages**.

# 📝 Full Prompt (React + React Router + CSS Modules)

```
I want to build a **Hotel ERP frontend** in **React + React Router + CSS Modules** with role-based routing.  

Please create a **project skeleton** with the following structure and routes:

---

## Routes

1. **Admin (`/admin`)**
   - `/admin/dashboard`
   - `/admin/rooms`
   - `/admin/restaurant`
   - `/admin/gym`
   - `/admin/crm`
   - `/admin/property`
   - `/admin/staff`
   - `/admin/reports`
   - `/admin/settings`

2. **Employer (Staff controllers)**
   - **Rooms Staff**
     - `/employer/rooms/dashboard`
     - `/employer/rooms/tasks`
     - `/employer/rooms/shifts`
   - **Restaurant Staff**
     - `/employer/restaurant/dashboard`
     - `/employer/restaurant/orders`
     - `/employer/restaurant/inventory`
   - **Gym Staff**
     - `/employer/gym/dashboard`
     - `/employer/gym/trainer-schedule`
     - `/employer/gym/classes`

3. **Public (User/Guest)**
   - `/` → Home
   - `/rooms` → Browse + Book rooms
   - `/restaurant` → Menu + My Orders
   - `/gym` → Class schedule
   - `/rewards` → Loyalty & CRM
   - `/profile` → User profile

✅ Deliverables in this skeleton:

* **Admin pages** → all modules
* **Employer pages** → separated controllers (Rooms, Restaurant, Gym)
* **User (Public)** → Home + services booking
* **Folder structure** ready for scaling
* **React Router v6** based route definitions
