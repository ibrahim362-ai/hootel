# Quick GitHub Pages Deployment for Your Hotel ERP System

## Fix Git Error and Deploy

Since you're getting the "UNKNOWN_REF" error, here's the exact fix:

### Step 1: Commit and Push Your Changes

```bash
# Add all your new files
git add .

# Commit everything
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment setup"

# Push to establish the remote branch tracking
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository: **https://github.com/ibrahim362-ai/hootel**
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running
3. Wait for green checkmark (2-5 minutes)
4. Your site will be live at: **https://ibrahim362-ai.github.io/hootel/**

## Alternative: Use the Deploy Script

After the initial push, you can use:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

## What Happens Next

The GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
2. Build your React app (`npm run build`)
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages automatically
4. Your Hotel ERP System will be live!

## Your Live Site Features

Once deployed, visitors can access:
- **User Interface**: Modern booking system, restaurant menu, gym schedules
- **Employer Interface**: Three specialized controllers (Rooms, Restaurant, Gym)
- **Modern Design**: #3a86ff gradient theme with glassmorphism effects
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

If you still get Git errors:
```bash
# Check your current branch
git branch

# Make sure you're on main
git checkout main

# Push with upstream tracking
git push -u origin main
```

Your Hotel ERP System is ready to go live!
