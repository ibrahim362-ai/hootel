# Final Deployment Steps - Fix Git Error

## The Problem
You're getting "UNKNOWN_REF - Remote ref of current branch is missing" because the local branch isn't properly tracking the remote branch.

## The Solution

### Option 1: Use the Fix Script (Recommended)
```bash
./fix-git-and-deploy.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps

# Add and commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add Hotel ERP System deployment setup"

# Push to GitHub

```

### Option 3: Force Push (If needed)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Hotel ERP System"
git push -f origin main
```
